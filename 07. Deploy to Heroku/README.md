## Objectives

1. Deploy Node/Mongo projects to Heroku

## The Production Environment

Any software project has at least three separate **Environments**

- **Development (DEV)** on local machines
- **Test (TEST)** on local machines or a separate test server
- **Production (PROD)** on a production server

Heroku will be the server we use for our Production environment. Heroku is a simple turn-key server solution that is free (but requires a credit card). Heroku also provides a rich marketplace of plugins to extend and enhance your server such as monitor bugs, speed, and add databases. We'll be using the "MongoLabs" plugin to add a production mongodb database to our project.

These environments can vary slightly.  Some differences between dev and prod will be what is in the database, or maybe the assets will be compiled, or a dozen other slight differences. As developers we try to keep these environments as similar to each other as possible because differences will make code that ran well in development break in production.

### Environment Variables in `process.env`

Sometimes you can't save everything into your code files because that would be insecure. For example, if you use a third party service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), then there will be sensitive keys that if you expose to the world on a public Github repo, hackers will steal them and use your codes to rack up hundreds of dollars in fees.

To secure such data, developers use encrypted environment variables that they store locally and in production.

The node package people use to define these variables is called [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Resources

## Baseline Challenges

**Challenge 1 - Getting Started**
1. [Get started with Heroku for Node](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) (45 min)

**Challenge 2 - Your Project**
1. Use `$ heroku create <<PROJECT NAME>>` to create a heroku project for your project.
1. Push your code to heroku and run `$ heroku open` to open your project. (It should be broken!)
1. Check the logs to see what is wrong `$ heroku logs`.
1. Point your server to listen to your dev and production port.

  ```js
  var port = process.env.PORT || '3000';
  server.listen(port);
  ```
1. Does it work now? What does logs say?
1. Uh oh no database! - Provision mongolab to add a mongo database to your production environment - `$ heroku addons:create mongolab`. Does your project work now?? Nope!
1. Look at your heroku config variables `$ heroku config`. Do you see the MONGODB_URI variable?
1. Point to your dev and production database URI using `process.env`

  ```js
  mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost/<<YOUR DATABASE NAME>>');
  ```
1. Now does your project work?

**Challenge 3 - Local Environment Variables**

1. If you want to use secure local environment variables, add `dotenv` to your project and load it by adding this code to the top of your main server js file. Now your `process.env` in development will contain any variables you define in your `.env` file in the root of your project.

  server.js
  ```js
    if (!process.env.PORT) {
      require('dotenv').config()  
    }
    // Rest of the file
  ```

  .env
  ```
   EMAIL_SECRET=diggitydiggitydog
  ```

  Access the variable
  ```js
    var secret = process.env.EMAIL_SECRET
  ```
