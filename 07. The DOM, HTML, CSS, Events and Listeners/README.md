## Overview: Leonardo Da Vinci & the Renaissance

Leonardo Da Vinci was a Renaissance polymath and multipotentialite. Who made significant contributions to invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. Designed a prototype of a helicopter, painted the Mona Lisa, and made strides in anatomy.

Italy did not exist when he lived, but he lived in what are now Italian cities, Florence, Milan, Rome, Bologna, Venice, and lived the final years of his life in France.

The DOM

## HTML

Each webpage is made up of a tree-like structure of HTML called the **DOM (Document Object Map)**.

So this snippet of HTML has the tree-like DOM structure in the image below.

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Title</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <a href="#">My Link</a>
    <h1>My header</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
