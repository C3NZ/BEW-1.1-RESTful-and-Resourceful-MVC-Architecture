# Full Stack 1 Personal Project Spec

## Objectives

1. Build an original single-resource website from the ground up.

## Requirements

1. **From Stratch** - Begin from scratch without any sort of template. You may look at any code you like, and copy and paste chunks of other code, but do not duplicate an entire other project.
1. **RESTful & Resourceful** - Include RESTful and Resourceful routing for at least 1 resource.
1. **Live on Heroku** - The project must be shipped live on heroku.
1. **Tests** - Make a full test suite of controller tests for your routes.
1. **Mobile Responsive** - Make a fully responsive, conventionally styled, front end using Bootstrap 3.
1. **Code Reviewed** - Have at least one code review from the instructor before the end of the course.

## Options

1. **Outside API** - You may use any API you like to integrate into your project.
1. **Pair Work** - You may work alone or in pairs - if you are going to work in pairs you must pair program for 90% of the time - this will mean significant coordination outside of class to schedule time to work side-by-side. You will be expected to turn in the project together. Pair programed projects are not expected to be more feature-full (because pp can be slower than solo programming sometimes), but they are expected to demonstrate significantly better code craftsmanship.
1. **2nd Resource** - You may add another resource if you like and look ahead to how to do reference and embedded documents.

## Project Writeup

Write a 500-1000 word post on medium.com.

## How to Turn In

1. Send two links (github and heroku) to your instructor before the final day of class.
